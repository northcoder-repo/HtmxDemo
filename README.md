# HTMX Demo
 
A simple demo showing how HTMX (with its suport for Ajax-in-HTML) can be integrated with Javalin and Thymeleaf.

Specifically, this focuses on how Thymeleaf fragments can be used to provide HTML responses to Ajax requests, without needing to create a separate Thymeleaf template file per fragment. Instead, multiple fragments can be placed in a single Thymeleaf template file.
